## Astigmatism in the brain
- In this project, I largely focused on how the brain compensates for the distorted orientation feature of astigmatic vision. 
- It is a crucial issue because 1) most populations have astigmatism at least in a minor amount, and more surprisingly, 2) it is highly likely that the visual impairment was not noticed yet. Many studies suspect that astigmatism is being modified within the brain, but little has been revealed.
- In terms of meridian-specific degradation of astigmatism, it causes feature-specific impairments, such as orientation and direction. Thus the topic can be combined with many topics in the traditional neuroscience topics, such as orientation adaptation, feature-based attention, predictive coding, perceptual learning, etc...
- This exemplifies well how the brain involves in everyday life with clinical implications. For example, if I were to have severe astigmatism with no neural compensation, I would lose the outlines of the hydrangeas' petals (left). However, with the additional help of the brain (middle), I am now able to see the natural continuous scenes (right). <br> <img src="data/astigex.png" align="center" width="50%" height="50%">>

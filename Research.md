## Astigmatism in the brain
- In this project, I largely focused on how the brain compensates for the distorted orientation feature of astigmatic vision. 
- It is a crucial issue because 1) most populations have astigmatism at least in a minor amount, and more surprisingly, 2) it is highly likely that the visual impairment was not noticed yet. Many studies suspect that astigmatism is being modified within the brain, but little has been revealed.
- In terms of meridian-specific degradation of astigmatism, it causes feature-specific impairments, such as orientation and direction. Thus the topic can be combined with many topics in the traditional neuroscience topics, such as orientation adaptation, feature-based attention, predictive coding, perceptual learning, etc...
- This exemplifies well how the brain involves in everyday life with clinical implications. For example, if I were to have severe astigmatism with no neural compensation, I would lose the outlines of the hydrangeas' petals (left). However, with the additional help of the brain (middle), I am now able to see the natural continuous scenes (right). <br> <center><img src="https://sangkyuson.github.io//data/astigex.png" width="50%" height="50%"></center>

## Perceptual continuity
- Our perception is the result of complex interactions of several dimensions of information distributed across neural substrates. These are not recognized in a distributed form, but as being integrated with various ways in the brain, just as I am feeling the continuity of the world, but how?
- Transmission of motion direction information according to temporal expectation 
  - How the brain transmits sensory inputs and expectation signals of an occluded objectâ€™s motion direction across neural substrates at the expected timing? 
  - We often experience moving objects appearing again after being briefly occluded in our daily lives. Previous studies have shown that the temporal expectation affects the representation of the object, but have not shown how the expectation dynamically transforms the representation to affect the following perception.

- Serial dependence in ensemble perception
  - How does the visual system balance stability against sensitivity when associating the past and the present in dynamically varying uncertainty?
  - To have temporal continuity, our visual system is biased toward the previous perception. On the other hand, to be sensitive to change in certain conditions, it is also necessary to distinguish the current preception from the previous. Previous studies have contrasted this with only different experimental conditions and have not been described in an integrated manner over successive moments.

- Time encoding during pain 
  - What is the neural basis for encoding a longer duration of visual stimulation when experiencing thermal pain?

## Topics

- Feature specific distortion and compensation of astigmatic vision 
  - Advisor: Dr. Joonyeol Lee, & Dr. Yee-Joon Kim, with Dr. Hyungoo Kang)
  -	How does the brain compensate for the distorted orientation feature of astigmatic vision?
 -	Revealed the neural distortion in feature space through multivariate analysis, extending from the contrast change that previous studies focused [[code]](https://semoconlab.com/codes/)
-	Explained the neural compensation of astigmatism through feature-specific gain modulation models on orientation-selective cells2 with neural evidence.

Transmission of motion direction information according to temporal expectation
(Advisor: Dr. Joonyeol Lee)
-	How the brain transmits sensory inputs and expectation signals of an occluded objectâ€™s motion direction across neural substrates at the expected timing? 
-	Discovered the EEG pattern of direction information revived at the expected timing, and delta traveling waves take a crucial role in conveying it across neural substrates3. 

Time perception during pain (Advisor: Dr. Yee-Joon Kim, with Dr. Dongho Kim)
-	What is the neural basis of lengthened time perception when suffering thermal pain?
Serial dependence in ensemble perception (Advisor: Dr. Yee-Joon Kim, with Dr. Ohsang Kwon)
-	How does the visual system balance stability against sensitivity when associating the past and the present in dynamically varying uncertainty?
-	Unified two opposing contextual effects of stimuli variability using Bayesian modeling adopting efficient coding theory4.
